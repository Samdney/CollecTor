<h1>CollecTor &mdash; your friendly data-collecting service in the Tor
network</h1>

<p>
Welcome to CollecTor, your friendly data-collecting service in the Tor
network.
CollecTor fetches data from various nodes and services in the public Tor
network and makes it available to the world.
If you're doing research on the Tor network, or if you're developing an
application that uses Tor network data, this is your place to start.

<h3>Archive of monthly tarballs <a href="#archive">#</a></h3>

<p>
We have over 10 years of Tor network data available for download in
monthly tarballs.
The latest tarballs are updated every few days.
So, if you want to fetch data covering an extended period of time, monthly
tarballs are for you.
Note that tarballs can decompress to 20 times the compressed size or even
more.
</p>

<p>
Monthly tarballs can be browsed and downloaded here:

<div class="box">

<a name="recent"></a>
<h3>The latest 72 hours <a href="#recent">#</a></h3>

<p>
If you're only interested in recently published data, we also have data
from the last 72 hours available for you.
In contrast to monthly tarballs, this data set is updated every hour.
If you have already bootstrapped your application with monthly tarballs
and want to stay up-to-date, or if you just want to take a peak at the
latest data, this is your data set.
</p>

<p>
The latest 72 hours of data are also available here:
