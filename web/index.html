<h2>Your friendly data-collecting service in the Tor network</h2>

<p>
Welcome to CollecTor, your friendly data-collecting service in the Tor
network.
CollecTor fetches data from various nodes and services in the public Tor
network and makes it available to the world.
If you're doing research on the Tor network, or if you're developing an
application that uses Tor network data, this is your place to start.

<h2>What is in the data? <a href="#formats">#</a></h2>

<p>
The Tor network data provided here comes from currently five different
sources (each of which is explained in more detail on a
<a href="formats.html">separate page</a>):
</p>

<ol>
<li>Relays and directory authorities publish
<a href="formats.html#relay-descriptors">relay descriptors</a>, so that
clients can select relays for their paths through the Tor network.</li>
<li>Bridges and the bridge authority publish
<a href="formats.html#bridge-descriptors">bridge descriptors</a> that are
used by censored clients to connect to the Tor network.</li>
<li>The bridge distribution service BridgeDB publishes
<a href="formats.html#bridge-pool-assignments">bridge pool assignments</a>
describing which bridges it has assigned to which distribution pool.</li>
<li>The exit list service TorDNSEL publishes
<a href="formats.html#exit-lists">exit lists</a> containing the IP
addresses of relays that it found when exiting through them.</li>
<li>The performance measurement service Torperf publishes
<a href="formats.html#torperf">performance data</a> from making simple
HTTP requests over the Tor network.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Where do I get the data? <a href="#download">#</a></h2>

<p>
We have over 10 years of Tor network data available for download in
monthly tarballs.
The latest tarballs are updated every few days.
So, if you want to fetch data covering an extended period of time, monthly
tarballs are for you.
Just be careful: these tarballs can decompress to 20 times the compressed
size or even more.
Monthly tarballs can be browsed and downloaded in the
<a href="archive/"><tt>archive/</tt></a> subdirectory.
</p>

<p>
If you're only interested in recently published data, we also have data
from the last 72 hours available for you.
In contrast to monthly tarballs, this data set is updated every hour.
If you have already bootstrapped your application with monthly tarballs
and want to stay up-to-date, or if you just want to take a peak at the
latest data, this is your data set.
If you're using special software to download these files, you may want to
configure it to accept gzip-compressed data to save us all some bandwidth.
The latest 72 hours of data are available in the
<a href="recent/"><tt>recent/</tt></a> subdirectory.

<a name="libraries"></a>
<h2>How can I parse the data? <a href="#libraries">#</a></h2>

<p>
We developed two parsing libraries, one for Java and one for Python:
</p>

<ul>
<li>If you're programming in Java, try out the
<a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/metrics-lib.git">metrics-lib</a>
library.</li>
<li>If you're writing in Python,
<a href="https://stem.torproject.org/">Stem</a> is your library.</li>
</ul>

<p>
If you developed a parsing library for another language and want it to be
listed here, <a href="#support">please let us know</a>!</h2>
</p>

</div> <!-- box -->

<div class="box">

<a name="references"></a>
<h2>What did others do with the data? <a href="#references">#</a></h2>

<p>
We wrote a couple of applications, and researchers wrote research papers
using the Tor network data provided here.
The following list is not at all exhaustive:
</p>

<ul>
<li>The metrics portal shows graphs of
<a href="https://metrics.torproject.org/network.html">network growth over
time</a> and <a href="https://metrics.torproject.org/users.html">estimates
of users derived from directory activity</a>.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://exonerator.torproject.org/">ExoneraTor
service</a> allows people to look up whether a given IP address was part
of the Tor network in the past.</li>
<li>The websites <a href="https://atlas.torproject.org/">Atlas</a>,
<a href="https://globe.torproject.org/">Globe</a>, and
<a href="https://compass.torproject.org/">Compass</a> let users explore
how specific relays or bridges contribute to the Tor network.
They all use <a href="https://onionoo.torproject.org/">Onionoo</a> as
their data back-end service which in turn uses the Tor network data
provided here.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://ts.mkj.lt/">Searchable Tor Metrics Archive</a>
allows users to search and explore relay metrics data (consensuses and
descriptors), present and past.
It covers the years 2008&ndash;now and provides an
<a href="https://onionoo.torproject.org/protocol.html">Onionoo-like
API</a>.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://shadow.github.io/">Shadow Simulator</a> uses
archived Tor directory data to generate network topologies that match the
real Tor network as close as possible.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://torps.github.io/">Tor Path Simulator</a> uses Tor
directory archive data to simulate the effect of changes to Tor's path
selection algorithm.</li>
</ul>

<p>
If you wrote an application or research paper that uses Tor network data
and that is not yet listed here, <a href="#support">please let us
know</a>!</h2>
Please include a short description what your application does or what your
research was about.

<h2>How can I get support? <a href="#support">#</a></h2>

<p>
If you have any questions about the Tor network data provided here, we'd
like to <a href="mailto:help@rt.torproject.org">hear from you</a>!
Of course, suggestions or other feedback are welcome, too.
